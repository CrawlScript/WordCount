BEIJING, Nov. 26 (Xinhuanet) -- It was a busy weekend for the world of Mandopop as Taiwan pop star Jay Chou wrapped up the Hong Kong leg of his "Opus 2 World Tour" on Monday. The "Opus World Tour" kicked off in 2013, taking Chou across the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Southeast Asia. For his latest tour, Chou was originally scheduled to perform for 4 nights in Hong Kong but after tickets quickly sold out, two more shows were added. On his last night in Hong Kong, Chou sang for nearly 3 hours and came back on stage for several encore performances for his insatiable fans. The 35-year-old singer said that it was tough to say good bye when the curtain call came. Chou is one of the best-selling pop artists to come out of Taiwan in the past decade. He changed the landscape of the Mandarin pop industry with R and B, hip-hop styled songs. In addition to a successful music career, Chou also writes scripts, direct films and acts in movies. In 2011, he played the role of Kato to Seth Rogen's "Green Hornet." And it was just announced that Chou will be returning to Hollywood for the sequel to the 2013 crime thriller "Now You See Me." The next stop of the "Opus 2 World Tour" will be in Singapore on December 27th. (Source: CNTV.cn)
