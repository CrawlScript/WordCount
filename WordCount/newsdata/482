BEIJING, Nov. 26 (Xinhuanet) -- The State Council said Wednesday policy makers will open more sectors such as public services, environmental protection, eco-system building and infrastructure to non-state capital. The process though, will continue to be supported in conjunction with government investment into these areas as well. The State Council also says more channels of investment will be extended for private capital it's all in a bid to let the markets play a more "decisive" role in the Chinese economy. (Source: CNTV.cn)
